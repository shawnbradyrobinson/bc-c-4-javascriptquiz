The application has an inviting and minimal interface. 

After the user presses the "start" button, the quiz will begin! 

Users gain five points for each question they get correct. They will also be rewarded with an attractive sound effect! 

Users gain zero points if they answer incorrectly. Ten seconds will also be deducted from their overall time to finish!

Elements that make this Javascript quiz stand out from other available options is the fact that the application provides the user with audio feedback to know whether they were correct or incorrect on their last question.

Also, the application stores how many attempts users have taken on the quiz overall. 

How long will it take YOU to hit a high score? Try the "Javascript Quiz" application today!
